dotfiles
========


Here you can find the configuration files I use for some programs in GNU / Linux
They are hosted in diferent files accordin to the program they belong

* Disclaimer: This is a work under continious development, so use it under your
  own risk

# My dotfiles

Feel free to use them in your own system

Files you will find:

* .vimrc ( VIM Configuration file )
* .emacs ( Emacs configuration file )
* pylint/pylint.rc ( Pylint configuration file )
How to use:

Clone this repository and create simbolic links from the files to your personal folder

`git clone https://github.com/voylinux/dotfiles.git`
<br/>
`ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
`ln -s ~/dotfiles/.emacs ~/.emacs`
`ln -s ~/dotfiles/pylint/pytlint.rc ~/.pylintrc`
